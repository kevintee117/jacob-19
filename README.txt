Using the spectral template form HTML 5 up, I created a website for Jacob Pascua in lieu of a physical card. I hoped to create a sort of modern scrapbook commemorating a few recent memories. As I had limited time to create it due to also planning a surprise party concurrently, I didn't have enough time to create a more fully fledged "scrapbook" feel. Website is viewable at http://kevintee117.github.io/jacob-19
